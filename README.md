# ActEarly
This is a repository of some of the systems work on ActEarly, I 5 year research project based in Bradford and Towerhamlets. You can read more abou the project [here](https://actearly.org.uk/).

There are a few files included, one is the visualisation of the mapping of ActEarly projects onto the Child Health System (shown below) that was published in (coming soon).
In the image the network was developed from the paper [A systems map of the determinants of child health inequalities in England at the local level](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245577), and the size of the nodes shows the number ActEarly projects that map to that part of the child health system. An interactive version of this visualisation is availble here (coming soon).
